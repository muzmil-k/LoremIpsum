                    <h1>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h1>
                    <P>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make
                        sure therefore that you
                        read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any
                        part of the app, or our
                        trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and
                        you also shouldn’t try
                        to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all
                        the trade marks,
                        copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to
                        XCompany.</P>
                    <P>XCompany is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that
                        reason, we reserve the
                        right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
                        We will never charge you
                        for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                    </P>
                    <P>The xcomp app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to
                        provide our Service. It’s
                        your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that
                        you do not jailbreak or
                        root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed
                        by the official
                        operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
                        malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise
                        your phone’s security features and it could mean that the xcomp app won’t work properly or at
                        all.</P>
                    <P>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</P>
                    <p>Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the app<a href="">-AdMob-</a>and
                        <a href="">-Google Analytics for Firebase-</a></p>
                    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that XCompany will not take responsibility for.
                        Certain functions of
                        the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi,
                        or provided by your
                        mobile network provider, but XCompany cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                        functionality if you
                        don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
                    <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
                        agreement with your
                        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile
                        provider for the cost of data
                        for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In
                        using the app, you’re
                        accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app
                        outside of your home
                        territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill
                        payer for the device on
                        which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
                        from the bill payer for
                        using the app.</p>
                    <p>Along the same lines, XCompany cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e.
                        You need to make sure
                        that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
                        Service, XCompany
                        cannot accept responsibility.</p>
                    <p>With respect to XCompany’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app,
                        it’s important to bear in
                        mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
                        rely on third parties to
                        provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. XCompany accepts no liability
                        for any loss, direct or
                        indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
                    <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS –
                        the requirements for
                        both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to)
                        may change, and you’ll
                        need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. XCompany does not promise that
                        it will always update the
                        app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have
                        installed on your device.
                        However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                        also wish to stop providing
                        the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                        Unless we tell you
                        otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will
                        end; (b) you must stop
                        using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
